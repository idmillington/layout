Icosagon Layout
===============

This package lays out content using a hierarchy of fitting
algorithms. It is used to construct pages or UI output with complex
constraints and overlapping content.

It is largely output-agnostic, although there are a set of
:mod:`layout.elements` that use reportlab's
:mod:`~reportlab.pdfgen` to do their output.
