Layout
======

Layout is a high-level Python package for laying out content,
primarily for print.

It uses a hierarchy of fitting algorithms to construct pages or UI output
with complex constraints and overlapping content.

It has two components, the layout managers position and size content, and
there are a set of :mod:`layout.elements` that can display common content
types, such as images or text.

A utility library targets reportlab's :mod:`~reportlab.pdfgen` for output.
